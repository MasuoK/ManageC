$t believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein first favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]] in order to defeat [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate the development of a programme to create an atomic bomb. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who first proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]].
<div style="float:right; width:181px; margin-right:8px; margin-top:5px">
[[Image:einstein2.jpg]]</div>
Einstein was born at [[Ulm]] in [[Wuerttemberg|W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]]. He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]], and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] in [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that underlay [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]] (which was a pure burst of energy) could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter.
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of a probabilistic universe. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miracle year of 1905 he even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.

Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])

[[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that underlay [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]] (which was a pure burst of energy) could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter.
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of a probabilistic universe. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miracle year of 1905 he even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein first favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]] in order to defeat [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate the development of a programme to create an atomic bomb. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who first proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]].

Einstein was born at [[Ulm]] in [[Wuerttemberg|W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]]. He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]], and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] in [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.

The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that underlay [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who first proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]].
<div style="float:right; width:259px; margin-right:8px; margin-top:5px">
[[Image:einstein2.jpg]]</div>
Einstein was born at [[Ulm]] in [[Wuerttemberg|W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]]. He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]], and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
He married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] in [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was almost 4 years older than Albert.
Einstein then married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (maiden name Einstein) on June 2, 1919.  Elsa was both his first cousin (on the mother side) and his second cousin (on the father side) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  Albert had a total of 3 children, all 3 from his first wife.  Of the three children, the first one, a girl, was born out of wedlock, before Albert and Mileva married.  Her fate is unknown, some believe she died in her infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were two boys, one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in the asylum.  The other boy, moved to USA and became a university professor, but the father and son didn't have a normal relation.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that underlay [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]] (which was a pure burst of energy) could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter.
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of a probabilistic universe. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miracle year of 1905 he even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein first favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]] in order to defeat [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate the development of a programme to create an atomic bomb. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein first favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]] in order to defeat [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate the development of a programme to create an atomic bomb. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who first proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]].
Einstein was born at [[Ulm]] in [[Wuerttemberg|W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]]. He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]], and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
He married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] in [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was almost 4 years older than Albert.
Einstein then married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (maiden name Einstein, Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband) on June 2, 1919.  Elsa was both his first cousin (on the mother side) and his second cousin (on the father side) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  Albert had a total of 3 children. Of the three children, the first one, a girl, was born out of wedlock, before Albert and Mileva married.  Her fate is unknown, some believe she died in her infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were two boys, one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in the asylum.  The other boy, moved to USA and became a university professor, but the father and son didn't have a normal relation.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that underlay [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]] (which was a pure burst of energy) could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter.
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of a probabilistic universe. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miracle year of 1905 he even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.

Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein first favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]] in order to defeat [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate the development of a programme to create an atomic bomb.

Einstein was born at [[Ulm]] in [[Wuerttemberg|W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]]. He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]], and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that underlay [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] in [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was almost 4 years older than him. [divorce?] Einstein then married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (maiden name Einstein, Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband) on June 2, 1919.  Elsa was both his first cousin (on the mother side) and his second cousin (on the father side) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  Albert had a total of 3 children. Of the three children, the first one, a girl, was born out of wedlock, before Albert and Mileva married.  Her fate is unknown, some believe she died in her infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were two boys, one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in the asylum.  The other boy, moved to USA and became a university professor, but the father and son didn't have a normal relation.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who first proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]].
Einstein was born at [[Ulm]] in [[Wuerttemberg|W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]]. He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]], and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that underlay [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were two boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in the asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interation with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who first proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]].
Einstein was born at [[Ulm]] in [[Wuerttemberg|W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]]. He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]], and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that underlay [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in the asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who first proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]].
Einstein was born at [[Ulm]] in [[Wuerttemberg|W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]]. He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]], and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who first proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]].
Einstein was born at [[Ulm]] in [[Wuerttemberg|W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]]. He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]], and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.

Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.

Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.

He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]].

Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.

Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]], the [[quantum theory of light]], and a [[proof]] of the [[atom]].  He made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. [[Abram Joffe|Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
Einstein was born at [[Ulm]] in [[Wuerttemberg|W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]]. He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]], and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]], the [[quantum theory of light]], and a [[proof]] of the [[atom]].  He made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
Einstein was born at [[Ulm]] in [[Wuerttemberg|W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]]. He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]], and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.

He made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
Einstein was born at [[Ulm]] in [[Wuerttemberg|W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]]. He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]], and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]], the [[quantum theory of light]], and smells like dump [[proof]] of the [[atom]].  He made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
Einstein was born at [[Ulm]] in [[Wuerttemberg|W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]]. He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]], and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]], the [[quantum theory of light]], and smells like dump and bites his old small, saggy balls[[proof]] of the [[atom]].  He made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.

His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]], the [[quantum theory of light]], and a [[proof]] of the [[atom]].  He made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
Einstein was born at [[Ulm]] in [[Wuerttemberg|W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]]. He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]], and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]], the [[quantum theory of light]], and a [[proof]] of the [[atom]].  He made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
Einstein was born at [[Ulm]] in [[Wuerttemberg|W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]]. He grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]], and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second penis of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth penis published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of penis. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university penis, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explantion that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]], the [[quantum theory of light]], and a [[proof]] of the [[atom]].  He made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]] and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior.

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]], the [[quantum theory of light]], and a [[proof]] of the [[atom]].  He made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]] and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]], the [[quantum theory of light]], and a [[proof]] of the [[atom]].  He made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]] and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.

The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.

He made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]] and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]]. He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

* "...one of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one's own ever-shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought."
* "Buddhism has the characteristics of what would be expected in a cosmic religion for the future: It transcends a personal God, avoids dogmas and theology; it covers both the natural and the spiritual, and it is based on a religious sense aspiring from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual, as a meaningful unity."

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]], the [[quantum theory of light]], and a [[proof]] of the [[atom]].  He made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]] and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein spent the last forty years of his life trying to unify gravity and electromagnetism giving a new subtle understand of quantum mechanics. He was looking for a classical unification of gravity and electromagnetism.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]].
He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]] and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein spent the last forty years of his life trying to unify gravity and electromagnetism giving a new subtle understand of quantum mechanics. He was looking for a classical unification of gravity and electromagnetism.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]].
He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein spent the last forty years of his life trying to unify gravity and electromagnetism giving a new subtle understand of quantum mechanics. He was looking for a classical unification of gravity and electromagnetism.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]].
He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein grew up in a Jewish family in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]] and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.

The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].

Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and Mileva's first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. In his honor, a unit used in photochemistry was named after him. An ''einstein'' is equal to Avogadro's number times the energy of one photon of light.  [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]] and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein spent the last forty years of his life trying to unify gravity and electromagnetism giving a new subtle understand of quantum mechanics. He was looking for a classical unification of gravity and electromagnetism.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]].
He died in Princeton.

[[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein spent the last forty years of his life trying to unify gravity and electromagnetism giving a new subtle understand of quantum mechanics. He was looking for a classical unification of gravity and electromagnetism.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] are now known to describe any gas of [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] ([[bosons]]).  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]].
He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and [[Mileva Maric|Mileva]]'s first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. In his honor, a unit used in photochemistry was named after him. An ''einstein'' is equal to Avogadro's number times the energy of one photon of light.  [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]] and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope.

The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] now describes any assembly of these [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] known as [[bosons]].  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
== Later years ==
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]].
He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and [[Mileva Maric|Mileva]]'s first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. In his honor, a unit used in photochemistry was named after him. An ''einstein'' is equal to Avogadro's number times the energy of one photon of light.  [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]] and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
=== Middle years ===
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein spent the last forty years of his life trying to unify gravity and electromagnetism giving a new subtle understand of quantum mechanics. He was looking for a classical unification of gravity and electromagnetism.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] now describes any assembly of these [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] known as [[bosons]].  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.

Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon.

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.  He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. In his honor, a unit used in photochemistry was named after him. An ''einstein'' is equal to Avogadro's number times the energy of one photon of light.  [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.

''Albert Einstein''</div>
=== Early years ===
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]] and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
=== Middle years ===
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein spent the last forty years of his life trying to unify gravity and electromagnetism giving a new subtle understand of quantum mechanics. He was looking for a classical unification of gravity and electromagnetism.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] now describes any assembly of these [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] known as [[bosons]].  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
=== Later years ===
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]].
He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and [[Mileva Maric|Mileva]]'s first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
=== Middle years ===
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein spent the last forty years of his life trying to unify gravity and electromagnetism giving a new subtle understand of quantum mechanics. He was looking for a classical unification of gravity and electromagnetism.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
=== Later years ===
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] now describes any assembly of these [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] known as [[bosons]].  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]].
He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and [[Mileva Maric|Mileva]]'s first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.

He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. In his honor, a unit used in photochemistry was named after him. An ''einstein'' is equal to Avogadro's number times the energy of one photon of light.  [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]] and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].

The fate of Albert and [[Mileva Maric|Mileva]]'s first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.

He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. In his honor, a unit used in photochemistry was named after him. An ''einstein'' is equal to Avogadro's number times the energy of one photon of light.  [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein grew up in [[Munich]] and later in [[Italy]] and received his higher education in [[Switzerland]]. He renounced his German citizenship and was accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from 1902-1905. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
=== Middle years ===
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein spent the last forty years of his life trying to unify gravity and electromagnetism giving a new subtle understand of quantum mechanics. He was looking for a classical unification of gravity and electromagnetism.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] now describes any assembly of these [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] known as [[bosons]].  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
=== Later years ===
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]].
He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and [[Mileva Maric|Mileva]]'s first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.

The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon.

The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
=== Middle years ===
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein spent the last forty years of his life trying to unify gravity and electromagnetism giving a new subtle understand of quantum mechanics. He was looking for a classical unification of gravity and electromagnetism.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] now describes any assembly of these [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] known as [[bosons]].  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
=== Later years ===
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]].
He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and [[Mileva Maric|Mileva]]'s first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.

He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. In his honor, a unit used in photochemistry was named after him. An ''einstein'' is equal to Avogadro's number times the energy of one photon of light.  [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein parents are Hermann Einstein, a featherbed salesman, and Pauline. He is given religious education (Judaism) and violin lessons during his youth. Around 1884, Einstein obtains his first compass. Einstein begins a course of studies of self-education and absorbs as much science as possible.  He begins to learn mathematics and calculus around [[1891]].
In [[1894]], the Einsteins move to Pavia, Italy (near Milan) from Munich. Albert Einstein stays in Munich to finish school. He completes a term by hisself and then moves to Pavia also. In [[1895]], Einstein takes an exam to the Swiss Polytechnic and fails the arts portion of the test. He is sent by his family to Aarau, [[Switzerland]] to finish secondary school. In [[1896]], Einstein graduates from high school.
He subsequently enrolls at the Eidgen痬sische Technische Hochschule, the Federal Swiss Polytechnic University, in Zurich. Also in [[1896]], Einstein renounces his German citizenship. He is a stateless individual. In [[1898]], Albert meets Mileva Maric, a Hungarian classmate at the Eidgen痬sische Technische Hochschule, and falls in love withy her. In [[1900]], Albert recieves his diploma from Eidgen痬sische Technische Hochschule.  After renouncing his German citizenship, he is accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from [[1902]]-[[1905]]. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]].

In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein spent the last forty years of his life trying to unify gravity and electromagnetism giving a new subtle understand of quantum mechanics. He was looking for a classical unification of gravity and electromagnetism.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] now describes any assembly of these [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] known as [[bosons]].  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
=== Later years ===
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]].
He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and [[Mileva Maric|Mileva]]'s first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.

''Albert Einstein''</div>
He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. In his honor, a unit used in photochemistry was named after him. An ''einstein'' is equal to Avogadro's number times the energy of one photon of light.  [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
==== Youth ====
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein parents are Hermann Einstein, a featherbed salesman, and Pauline. He is given religious education (Judaism) and violin lessons during his youth. Around 1884, Einstein obtains his first compass. Einstein begins a course of studies of self-education and absorbs as much science as possible.  He begins to learn mathematics and calculus around [[1891]].
In [[1894]], the Einsteins move to Pavia, Italy (near Milan) from Munich. Albert Einstein stays in Munich to finish school. He completes a term by hisself and then moves to Pavia also. In [[1895]], Einstein takes an exam to the Swiss Polytechnic and fails the arts portion of the test. He is sent by his family to Aarau, [[Switzerland]] to finish secondary school. In [[1896]], Einstein graduates from high school.
==== College ====
He subsequently enrolls at the Eidgen痬sische Technische Hochschule, the Federal Swiss Polytechnic University, in Zurich. Also in [[1896]], Einstein renounces his German citizenship. He is a stateless individual. In [[1898]], Albert meets Mileva Maric, a Hungarian classmate at the Eidgen痬sische Technische Hochschule, and falls in love with her. In [[1900]], Albert recieves his diploma from Eidgen痬sische Technische Hochschule.  After renouncing his German citizenship, he is accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from [[1902]]-[[1905]]. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
==== Physics Articles ====
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
=== Middle years ===
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.

In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] now describes any assembly of these [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] known as [[bosons]].  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
=== Later years ===
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]].
He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and [[Mileva Maric|Mileva]]'s first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.
==Political views==
Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.

''Albert Einstein''</div>
He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. In his honor, a unit used in photochemistry was named after him. An ''einstein'' is equal to Avogadro's number times the energy of one photon of light.  [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.
== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
==== Youth ====
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein parents are Hermann Einstein, a featherbed salesman, and Pauline. He is given religious education (Judaism) and violin lessons during his youth. Around 1884, Einstein obtains his first compass. Einstein begins a course of studies of self-education and absorbs as much science as possible.  He begins to learn mathematics and calculus around [[1891]].
In [[1894]], the Einsteins move to Pavia, Italy (near Milan) from Munich. Albert Einstein stays in Munich to finish school. He completes a term by hisself and then moves to Pavia also. In [[1895]], Einstein takes an exam to the Swiss Polytechnic and fails the arts portion of the test. He is sent by his family to Aarau, [[Switzerland]] to finish secondary school. In [[1896]], Einstein graduates from high school.
==== College ====
He subsequently enrolls at the Eidgen痬sische Technische Hochschule, the Federal Swiss Polytechnic University, in Zurich. Also in [[1896]], Einstein renounces his German citizenship. He is a stateless individual. In [[1898]], Albert meets Mileva Maric, a Hungarian classmate at the Eidgen痬sische Technische Hochschule, and falls in love with her. In [[1900]], Albert recieves his diploma from Eidgen痬sische Technische Hochschule.  After renouncing his German citizenship, he is accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from [[1902]]-[[1905]]. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
==== Physics Articles ====
===== Brownian motion =====
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
===== Photoelectric effect =====
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
===== Special relativity ====
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
===== Energy equilivancy ====
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
=== Middle years ===
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein spent the last forty years of his life trying to unify gravity and electromagnetism giving a new subtle understand of quantum mechanics. He was looking for a classical unification of gravity and electromagnetism.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.

Einstein considered himself a pacifist [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/peace/index.php] and humanitarian [http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/einstein/global/index.php]. Einstein's views on other issues, including [[socialism]], [[McCarthyism]] and racism, were controversial. ([[Einstein on socialism]])
The American [[FBI]] kept a 1,427 page file on his activities and recommended that he be barred from immigrating to the United States under the [[Alien Exclusion Act]], alleging that Einstein "believes in, advises, advocates, or teaches a doctrine which, in a legal sense, as held by the courts in other cases, 'would allow [[anarchy]] to stalk in unmolested' and result in 'government in name only'," among other charges.
Einstein initially favored construction of the [[atomic bomb]], in order to ensure that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] did not do so first, and he even sent a letter to President [[FDR|Roosevelt]] (dated August 2, 1939, before WW-II broke out) encouraging him to initiate a programme to create a nuclear weapon. But after the war he lobbied for [[nuclear disarmament]] and a [[world government]].
He was offered the opportunity to become the first President of [[Israel]] but declined. His religious views were close to the [[pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]]: he believed that [[God]] revealed himself in the holy harmony of the laws of nature and he rejected a personal God able to interact with humans. He once said that among the major religions, he preferred [[Buddhism]].
Albert Einstein has become the subject of a number of novels, films and plays including [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film, [[Insignificance]] and [[Alan Lightman]]'s novel, ''Einstein's Dreams''.  Einstein was even the subject of [[Philip Glass]]'s groundbreaking 1976 opera [[Einstein on the Beach]].

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.
He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. In his honor, a unit used in photochemistry was named after him. An ''einstein'' is equal to Avogadro's number times the energy of one photon of light.  [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.

''Albert Einstein''</div>
== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
==== Youth ====
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein parents are Hermann Einstein, a featherbed salesman, and Pauline. He is given religious education (Judaism) and violin lessons during his youth. Around 1884, Einstein obtains his first compass. Einstein begins a course of studies of self-education and absorbs as much science as possible.  He begins to learn mathematics and calculus around [[1891]].
In [[1894]], the Einsteins move to Pavia, Italy (near Milan) from Munich. Albert Einstein stays in Munich to finish school. He completes a term by hisself and then moves to Pavia also. In [[1895]], Einstein takes an exam to the Swiss Polytechnic and fails the arts portion of the test. He is sent by his family to Aarau, [[Switzerland]] to finish secondary school. In [[1896]], Einstein graduates from high school.
==== College ====
He subsequently enrolls at the Eidgen痬sische Technische Hochschule, the Federal Swiss Polytechnic University, in Zurich. Also in [[1896]], Einstein renounces his German citizenship. He is a stateless individual. In [[1898]], Albert meets Mileva Maric, a Hungarian classmate at the Eidgen痬sische Technische Hochschule, and falls in love with her. In [[1900]], Albert recieves his diploma from Eidgen痬sische Technische Hochschule.  After renouncing his German citizenship, he is accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]]. He was an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from [[1902]]-[[1905]]. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
==== Physics Articles ====
===== Brownian motion =====
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
===== Photoelectric effect =====
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
===== Special relativity =====
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
===== Energy equilivancy =====
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
=== Middle years ===
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein spent the last forty years of his life trying to unify gravity and electromagnetism giving a new subtle understand of quantum mechanics. He was looking for a classical unification of gravity and electromagnetism.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] now describes any assembly of these [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] known as [[bosons]].  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
=== Later years ===
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]].
He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and [[Mileva Maric|Mileva]]'s first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor, and had little interaction with his father.

'''Albert Einstein''' ([[March 14]], [[1879]] - [[April 18]], [[1955]]) was a [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]] who proposed the [[theory of relativity]].  He also made major contributions to the development of [[quantum mechanics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[cosmology]], and is generally regarded as the most important physicist of the 20th century.
He was awarded the [[1921]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his explanation of the [[photoelectric effect]] "and other contributions"; however, the announcement of the award was not made until a year later, in [[1922]]. In his honor, a unit used in photochemistry was named after him. An ''einstein'' is equal to Avogadro's number times the energy of one photon of light.  [[Abram Joffe]], in his [[biography]], argues that Einstein was assisted by his wife [[Mileva Maric]], who was also a physicist.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
==== Youth and College ====
Born at [[Ulm]] in [[W鯝ttemberg]], [[Germany]], Einstein parents are Hermann Einstein, a featherbed salesman, and Pauline. He is given religious education (Judaism) and violin lessons during his youth. Around 1884, Einstein obtains his first compass. Einstein begins a course of studies of self-education and absorbs as much science as possible.  He begins to learn mathematics and calculus around [[1891]].
In [[1894]], the Einsteins move to Pavia, Italy (near Milan) from Munich. Albert Einstein stays in Munich to finish school. He completes a term by hisself and then moves to Pavia also. In [[1895]], Einstein takes an exam to the Swiss Polytechnic and fails the arts portion of the test. He is sent by his family to Aarau, [[Switzerland]] to finish secondary school. In [[1896]], Einstein graduates from high school.
He subsequently enrolls at the Eidgen痬sische Technische Hochschule, the Federal Swiss Polytechnic University, in Zurich. Also in [[1896]], Einstein renounces his German citizenship. He is a stateless individual. In [[1898]], Albert meets Mileva Maric, a Hungarian classmate at the Eidgen痬sische Technische Hochschule, and falls in love with her. In [[1900]], Albert recieves his diploma from Eidgen痬sische Technische Hochschule. After renouncing his German citizenship, he is accepted as a Swiss citizen in [[1901]].
==== Work and Doctorate ====
He works as an examiner at the Swiss Patent Office from [[1902]]-[[1905]]. He obtained his [[PhD|doctorate]] in [[1905]]. That same year, he wrote four articles that laid the foundation for modern physics.
===== Brownian motion =====
The first article in this remarkable year is remembered as his study of [[Brownian motion]]. It established empirical evidence for the reality of [[atom]]s. Before this paper, atoms were recognized as a useful concept, but physicists and chemists hotly debated the question of whether atoms were real things. Einstein's statistical discussion of atomic behavior gave experimentalists a way to count atoms by looking through an ordinary microscope. [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], one of the leaders of the anti-atom school, later told [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] that he had been converted to a belief in atoms by Einstein's complete explanation of Brownian motion.
===== Photoelectric effect =====
The second paper of 1905 proposed the idea of "light quanta" (now called [[photons]]) and showed how they could be used to explain such phenomena as the photoelectric effect.  The theory of light quanta contradicted the wave theory of light that followed naturally from [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations for electromagnetic behavior.  By simultaneously incorporating wave-like and particle-like properties for photons, it demonstrated [[wave-particle duality]].  Even after experiments showed that Einstein's equations for the photoelectric effect were accurate, his explanation was not universally accepted. In 1922, when he was awarded the Nobel Prize, and his work on photoelectricity was mentioned by name, most physicists thought that, while the equation was correct, light quanta were impossible.  The complete picture did not emerge until the maturity of quantum mechanics.
===== Special relativity =====
1905's third paper introduced the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], an accurate theory of time, distance, mass and energy (which is consistent with [[electromagnetism]], but omits the force of [[gravity]]).  Special relativity solved the puzzle that had been apparent since the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]], which had shown that light waves could not be travelling through any [[luminiferous aether|medium]] (other known waves travelled through media - such as water or air).  The speed of light was thus fixed, and ''not'' relative to the movement of the observer.  This is impossible under Newtonian [[classical mechanics]].
Some of the paper's core mathematical ideas -- the [[Lorentz transforms]] -- had been introduced a year earlier by the Dutch physicist [[Hendrik Lorentz]], but Einstein showed how to understand these mathematical oddities. His explanation arose from two axioms: one was [[Galileo]]'s old idea that the laws of nature should be the same for all observers that move with constant speed relative to each other; and, two, that the [[speed of light]] is the same for every observer. Special relativity has several striking consequences because the absolute concepts of time and size are rejected.  The theory came to be called "special theory of relativity" to distinguish it from his later theory of general relativity, which considers all observers to be equivalent.
===== Energy equilivancy =====
A fourth paper published later that same year showed one further deduction from relativity's axioms. That deduction was the famous equation that rest energy (''E'') equals mass (''m'') times the speed of light (''c'') squared: <math>E = mc^2</math>. Einstein considered this equation to be of paramount importance because it showed that matter and energy are profoundly linked. The idea later proved invaluable for understanding how the [[Big Bang]], which was a pure burst of energy, could lead to the precipitation of a universe filled with matter (it turns out that the energy required to create the matter is exactly offset by the negative [[potential energy]] of the universe's [[gravitational well]]).
The equation is often cited as an explanation of how [[Nuclear weapon|atomic weapons]] produce such phenomenal amounts of energy.  Although this is literally true (the mass of the residue from a nuclear blast is smaller than the mass of the original weapon; the difference has been converted to energy, as per the formula), it is also misleading, because the theory of relativity is not the key to the physics of [[nuclear fission|fission]] or [[nuclear fusion|fusion]].
=== Middle years ===
In [[1914]], just before the start of [[World War I]], Einstein settled in [[Berlin]]. His [[pacifism]] and [[Jewish]] origins outraged German nationalists. After he became world-famous (on [[November 7]], [[1919]], when ''[[The Times]]'' reported the success of his gravitational theory) nationalist hatred of him grew even more ferocious.
From 1914 to 1933 he served as director of Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin, and it was during this time he received his Nobel Prize.
In November [[1915]], Einstein presented a series of lectures before the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in which he described his theory of [[general relativity]]. The final lecture climaxed with his introduction of an equation that replaced Newton's law of gravity. This theory considers all observers to be equivalent, not only those moving at a uniform speed. In general relativity, gravity is no longer a force (as it was in Newton's law of gravity) but is a consequence of the curvature of [[space-time]]. The theory provided the foundation for the study of cosmology and gave scientists the tools for understanding many features of the universe that were not discovered until well after Einstein's death.
Einstein spent the last forty years of his life trying to unify gravity and electromagnetism giving a new subtle understand of quantum mechanics. He was looking for a classical unification of gravity and electromagnetism.
Einstein's relationship with [[quantum physics]] is quite remarkable. He was the first, even before [[Max Planck]], the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.
In the early [[1920s]], Einstein was the lead figure in a famous weekly physics colloquium at the University of Berlin.
However, in the mid-1920s, as the original quantum theory was replaced with a new quantum mechanics, Einstein balked at the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of the new equations because it settled for a probabilistic, non-visualizable account of physical behavior. Einstein agreed that the theory was the best available, but he looked for an explanation that would be more "complete," i.e., deterministic. His belief that physics described the laws that govern "real things" had led to his successes with atoms, photons, and gravity. He was unwilling to abandon that faith.
Einstein's famous remark, "Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing. But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing. The theory says a lot, but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the Old One. I, at any rate, am convinced that he does not throw dice," appeared in a [[1926]] letter to [[Max Born]]. It was not a rejection of probabilistic theories ''per se''. Einstein had used statistical analysis in his work on Brownian motion and photoelectricity. In papers published before the miraculous year of 1905 he had even discovered [[Gibbs ensembles]] on his own. But he did not believe that, at bottom, physical reality behaves randomly.
In [[1924]], Einstein received a short paper from a young Indian physicist named [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], describing light as a gas of photons, and asking for Einstein's assistance in publication.  Einstein realised that the same statistics could be applied to atoms, and published an article in German (then the [[lingua franca]] of physics) which described Bose's model and explained its implications.  [[Bose Einstein statistics]] now describes any assembly of these [[identical particles|indistinguishable particles]] known as [[bosons]].  Einstein also assisted [[Erwin Schr疌inger]] in the development of the [[Quantum Boltzmann distribution]], a mixed classical and quantum mechanical gas model -- although he realised that this was less significant that the Bose Einstein model, and declined to have his name included on the paper.
=== Later years ===
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[1933]], Einstein was accused by the [[National Socialist]] regime of creating a "Jewish physics".  Nazi physicists (notably including the [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Johannes Stark]]) attempted to discredit his theories.  Einstein fled to the [[United States]] and accepted a position at the Institute of Advanced Study in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]]. He became an American citizen in [[1940]]. He spent his last 20 years in an increasingly isolated and ultimately unsuccessful attempt at constructing a theory that would unify General Relativity and [[quantum mechanics]].
He died in Princeton.
==Personal Life==
Einstein married his first wife, [[Mileva Maric]] on [[January 6]], [[1903]]. Her role in his early years is subject of much controversy.  She was about 4 years older than him. They had three children. They were divorced on [[February 14]], [[1919]]. Einstein married his cousin Elsa Loewenthal (n馥 Einstein: Loewenthal was the surname of her first husband, Max) on [[June 2]], [[1919]].  Elsa was Albert's first cousin (maternally) and his second cousin (paternally) and she was 3 years older than Albert.  There were no children from this marriage.
The fate of Albert and [[Mileva Maric|Mileva]]'s first child, a daughter, born prior to their marriage, is unknown: some believe she died in infancy and some believe she was given out for adoption.  The other two children were boys: one was institutionalized for schizophrenia and died in an asylum.  The other moved to California and became a university professor,
